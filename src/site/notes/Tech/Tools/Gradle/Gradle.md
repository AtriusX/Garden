[Gradle](https://gradle.org/) is a build tool that can be used in the development of projects of a variety of different languages. Of these, the most common used with this tool is Java and Kotlin. It covers the same use-case and purpose other build tools like [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) cover, so you typically will choose between one or the other when developing a project.

Both of these tools enable you to pull in external dependencies automatically, allowing you to define slim project definitions which can be retrieved and updated by engineers later on with minimal friction. Where Gradle differs in functionality however, is its ability to enable traditional scripting with your build scripts. For some this may be a beneficial feature or a significant over-complication of the purpose of a build tool. Whether or not this is ideal for you or not is up to you, though if you choose to use Gradle, below includes a number of articles describing some of the more obscure features you can make use of.
