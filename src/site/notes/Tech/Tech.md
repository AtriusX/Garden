Welcome to the *technology* catalog. This section of *The Nexus* is focused primarily on archiving my understanding of a wide array of tools and tech generally associated with computers and software.  This module may go over things such as 3D-modelling, general-use tools, software, programming languages, libraries, and frameworks, and much more. Information in this catalog is highly volatile compared to other catalogs, so expect this section to remain much more active than others.
