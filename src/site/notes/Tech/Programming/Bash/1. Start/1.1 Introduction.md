Bash is a general-use scripting language which is primarily geared towards automating repetitive tasks in the command line. This is usually something associated with Linux/MacOS terminals, but is able to run on Windows via WSL or a bash terminal emulator such as Git Bash. Windows has its own analogs to Bash in the forms of Batch and PowerShell scripting.
