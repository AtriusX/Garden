In some scenarios you might find out that you want to slightly adjust how a variable is resolved from its classifier. In Bash, we have the ability to do this in-place without modification or extra variable assignments using something called a Parameter Expansion.

```ad-info
To use a parameter expansion, these are typically declared by calling the variable in the format of `${variable[expansion]}`
```

Parameter expansions can be used to perform a number of different operations. This is most commonly to either lowercase or uppercase the entirety of a variable, though it can also be used for other things such as the ability to extract a substring from a variable, or to perform null coalescence.
#### Uppercase and Lowercase

To force a variable to all uppercase or lowercase, you should use the `^^` and `,,` expansions respectively.

```bash
# Lets set a variable with varying letter casing
example=AbCdEf

# Uppercase everything
echo ${example^^}
## Lowercase everything
echo ${example,,}
```

This can alternatively be achieved using `@U` or `@L` as well, and you also have the ability to capitalize only the first letter of a variable using `@u`:

```bash
# Lets set a variable with varying letter casing
example=AbCdEf
# Uppercase everything
echo ${example@U} 
# Lowercase everything
echo ${example@L}
# Define variables containing only lowercase or uppercase letters
lowercase=foo
# Change the case of only the first letter
echo ${lowercase@u}
```
### Substring

Sometimes we might want to extract a small portion of argument rather than the whole argument. Bash provides us with a way to do this by providing a substring expansion `:offset:length`

```bash
example="Hello World"
# Prints ello Wo
echo ${example:1:7}
# Prints Hello
echo ${example::5}
```

### Null Coalescence

Depending on circumstances, sometimes we may have a default value we would like to use in the event a variable is null or unset. Such cases are covered using an optional expansion `:-value`

```bash
test="Hello world!"
# Should set value to content of "test"
echo ${test:-This optional value should not be set}
# Should set value to optional fallback
echo ${missing:-This is a default value}
```

```ad-seealso
Bash also provides `:+value` as an inverse expansion. This will instead substitute in another value should the variable contain a non-null value. Though, this on its own is not particularly useful.
```

### Length

It is also possible to use parameter expansions to retrieve the length of a variable, you can do this using the length expansion `${#variable}`:

```bash
value="Test"
# Returns a length of 4
echo ${#value}
```

### Substitution

Bash also supports simple find & replace all syntax in the form of a parameter expansion. To use this, use the substitution expansion `//[find]/[replace]`:

```bash
value="Hello world!"
# Returns "Hello Bash!"
echo ${value//world/Bash}
```
