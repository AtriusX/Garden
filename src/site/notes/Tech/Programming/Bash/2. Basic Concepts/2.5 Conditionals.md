In most computing contexts, we very often must rely on the system being able to make decisions for us without requiring the user to step in. This is where the concept of **conditionals** comes into play.

Conditionals are a common programming construct, and many are familiar with the syntax in C-like languages. However, in the case of Bash, the way this is implemented differs by a fair amount. The language provides two distinct ways of doing comparisons, with slight difference depending on use-case. 

When it comes to files, strings, and numbers, you have a number of actions you can perform according to the GNU Documentation[^1]. The most common/useful operations have been marked in bold.

### File Operators

| *-t \<file>*            | True if file descriptor fd is open and refers to a terminal.                                               |

### String Operators

| Condition                     | Description                                             |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |

| **-n \<string>**              | True if the length of string is non-zero.               |
| *\<string>*                   | True if the length of string is non-zero.               |
| **\<string1> == \<string2>**  | True if the strings are equal.                          |
| **\<string1> != \<string2>**  | True if the strings are not equal.                      |
| *\<string1> < \<string2>*     | True if string1 sorts before string2 lexicographically. |
| *\<string1> > \<string2>*<br> | True if string1 sorts after string2 lexicographically.  |
### Arithmetic Operators

While most programming languages embrace some of the operators in the above section for their general comparisons. Bash does not use those operators for performing arithmetic checks. Instead, it is necessary to perform such checks using the following syntax options.

| Condition               | Description                                                        |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **\<arg1> -eq \<arg2>** | If the first number is equal to the second number.                 |
| **\<arg1> -ne \<arg2>** | If the first number is not equal to the second number.             |
| **\<arg1> -lt \<arg2>** | If the first number is less than the second number.                |
| **\<arg1> -le \<arg2>** | If the first number is less than or equal to the second number.    |
| **\<arg1> -gt \<arg2>** | If the first number is greater than the second number.             |
| **\<arg1> -ge \<arg2>** | If the first number is greater than or equal to the second number. |

## If / Else If / Else Statements
{ #8e91a9}


Conditionals are often used in control statements to alter the flow of scripts. If statements are one form of control statement which can be used to execute statements only under specific circumstances. Unlike other programming languages however, Bash implements the syntax for these statements in a fairly unique manner.

**Simple If statement:**

```bash
example="hello"

if [ $example != "world!" ]; then
	echo "Condition passed!"
fi

if [ $example == "foo" ]; then
	echo "This will not execute"
fi
```

**If/Else If Statement:**

```bash
example="hello"
# Will execute the second branch
if [ $example == "world!" ]; then
	echo "Branch A"
elif [ $example == "hello" ]; then
	echo "Branch B"
fi
```

**If / Else If / Else Statement:**

```bash
example="hello"
# Will execute the last branch
if [ $example == "world!" ]; then
	echo "Branch A"
elif [ $example != "hello" ]; then
	echo "Branch B"
else
	echo "No matching case!"
fi
```

> [!note] 
The `if` statement is one of several statements which must be terminated by the same keyword in opposite order. You can insert extra `else if` or `else` statements into the block, but it must otherwise be terminated by a matching `fi` keyword.
### Further Reading

If statements are not the only form of control flow components available to us in Bash, we also have the ability to use `case` statements to approach the problems from a different perspective. If you would like to read up on this, I encourage you to look through [[Tech/Programming/Bash/3. Advanced Concepts/3.3 Pattern Matching\|3.3 Pattern Matching]].
