Blender is a 3D software suite which supports the ability to model, rig, animate, and much more for 3D models. This is commonly used as a tool in 3D animation and game design pipelines. While I am a software engineer by trade, I use blender in my free time as a hobbyist. This catalog is a list of my personal notes on the subject, as such these will not touch on the software from a beginners perspective and may or may not be ordered or grouped properly in terms of category.
