Welcome to *Atri’s Quill*, a digital composition of the knowledge and resources I’ve cataloged over an extended period of time. This site is an extension of the Digital Garden[^1] concept. Its primary purpose is to function as a note-keeping space for my own personal studies, and as a way to quickly share information for concepts which I’ve previously explored with others.

This is an informal space; you can expect that the information presented here may change or evolve over time according to my understanding of the subject matter. While this is an informal space centered around the author, you are encouraged to take part in the cultivation of information provided here through the usage of the Giscus[^2] comment system.

This comment system solution was chosen due to the highly technical nature of this catalog, so if you do not have a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account, you will need to make one to participate.
