## Directions

- Take loafs of bread and break them down into cubes. Place in a large bowl and let them dry out until they are dry like croutons.
	- If this is too slow, you may instead place them on a baking sheet and throw them in the oven at low heat (**300F** - **325F**) until they reach the desired dryness.
- In a large deep pan, melt 2 sticks of butter and then add the diced onions and garlic until golden translucent, stir frequently.
- Add the last stick of butter, and salt/pepper to taste.
- Add broth and bring the mixture to a boil.
- Put the bread cubes in a large mixing bowl and pour in liquid mixture.
- Mix in the mixture until thoroughly saturated and doughy.
- Take large foil pan and place stuffing mixture inside. Spread evenly.
	- Once complete, cover the tray with foil.
- Place in the oven and bake at **375F** for 45 - 50 minutes
	- After this, remove the foil and cook for an additional 10 minutes at **425F** to crispen the top.

Once this is done cooking, let sit for 10 minutes and cut the stuffing into squares. Serve and enjoy!
