# Directions

- Grate equal parts cheddar and Jack and mix them together
- Cube the chicken, season generously with salt and pepper
- Sear the chicken on a pan with olive oil (no real set time but generally it takes longer than you think)
- Remove the chicken then saut√© the mushrooms on the same pan
- Lay a tortilla and just start topping half of it, go wild Fold tortilla then turn the stove to the lowest heat setting, those things are easy to burn
- Fry the things on the pan, making sure to monitor them carefully, flip them, get the things nice and toasted
- Take them out, cut them up into wedges, bada bing, bada boom

There ya have it, some of the most careless quesadillas ever, but in my opinion they're really good for the low brain effort it takes.
